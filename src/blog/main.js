            One night four college kids stayed out late, partying and having a good time.
            They paid no mind to the test they had scheduled for the next day and didn’t study.
            In the morning, they hatched a plan to get out of taking their test.
            They covered themselves with grease and dirt and went to the Dean’s office.
            Once there, they said they had been to a wedding the previous night and on the way back they got a flat tire
            and had to push the car back to campus.
            <br/><br/>
            The Dean listened to their tale of woe and thought.
            He offered them a retest three days later.
            They thanked him and accepted his offer.
            hat time.
            <br/><br/>
            When the test day arrived, they went to the Dean.
            The Dean put them all in separate rooms for the test.
            They were fine with this since they had all studied hard.
            Then they saw the test. It had 2 questions.
            <br/><br/>
            1) Your Name __________ (1 Points)
            <br/><br/>
            2) Which tire burst? __________ (99 Points)
            <br/><br/>
            Options – (a) Front Left (b) Front Right (c) Back Left (d) Back Right

            <br/><br/>
            <b>The lesson:</b> always be responsible and make wise decisions.

              Imagine you had a bank account that deposited $86,400 each morning.
              The account carries over no balance from day to day, allows you to keep no cash balance,
              and every evening cancels whatever part of the amount you had failed to use during the day.
              What would you do? Draw out every dollar each day!
              <br/><br/>
              We all have such a bank. Its name is Time.
              Every morning, it credits you with 86,400 seconds.
              Every night it writes off, as lost, whatever time you have failed to use wisely.
              It carries over no balance from day to day.
              It allows no overdraft so you can’t borrow against yourself or use more time than you have.
              Each day, the account starts fresh. Each night, it destroys an unused time.
              If you fail to use the day’s deposits, it’s your loss and you can’t appeal to get it back.
              <br/><br/>
              There is never any borrowing time. You can’t take a loan out on your time or against someone else’s.
              The time you have is the time you have and that is that.
              Time management is yours to decide how you spend the time, just as with money you decide how you spend the money.
              It is never the case of us not having enough time to do things,
              but the case of whether we want to do them and where they fall in our priorities.

                A popular speaker started off a seminar by holding up a $20 bill.
                A crowd of 200 had gathered to hear him speak.
                He asked, “Who would like this $20 bill?”
                <br/><br/>
                200 hands went up.
                <br/><br/>
                He said, “I am going to give this $20 to one of you but first, let me do this.” He crumpled the bill up.
                <br/><br/>
                He then asked, “Who still wants it?”
                <br/><br/>
                All 200 hands were still raised.
                <br/><br/>
                “Well,” he replied, “What if I do this?” Then he dropped the bill on the ground and stomped on it with his shoes.
                <br/><br/>
                He picked it up, and showed it to the crowd. The bill was all crumpled and dirty.
                <br/><br/>
                “Now who still wants it?”
                <br/><br/>
                All the hands still went up.
                <br/><br/>
                “My friends, I have just showed you a very important lesson.
                No matter what I did to the money, you still wanted it because it did not decrease in value.
                It was still worth $20. Many times in our lives, life crumples us and grinds us into the dirt.
                We make bad decisions or deal with poor circumstances. We feel worthless.
                But no matter what has happened or what will happen, you will never lose your value.
                <strong>You are special – Don’t ever forget it!</strong>
