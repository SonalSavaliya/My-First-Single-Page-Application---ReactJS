# Static Website Using React JS

This is a single page static website using React JS. It is about small inspiring stories and a few learning diffrent stuff like photography, documentries, etc and some best movies list according to me. 

To run this website, first we need to download npm (a latest version of Node Package Manager) and install it from https://nodejs.org/en/ and then open command in the terminal/command prompt : npm install -g create-react-app.

Now, to create a react app, we can use this command : create-react-app test
Here, test is app name, you can put anything whatever you want.

Then you have to go to inside the app folder and use this command to run application: npm start 
and the app will be open in the brower on localhost.
